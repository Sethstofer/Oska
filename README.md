# Oska

An emulation of the board game Oska, a game similar to checkers. The program uses the foundational Adversarial Search approach in AI, minimax, along with proper heuristics to determine good moves from bad moves and to choose the best option of the possibilities computed; this way, a player may play against the computer, similar (but far simpler) to a common chess computer game.
